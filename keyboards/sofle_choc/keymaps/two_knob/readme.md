# Two Knob Keymap for Sofle
![two_knobs_sofle](https://i.imgur.com/JqGPWCn.png)

This keymap is derived from Ergodox layouts and is adapted for the [The Sofle Choc variant by Brian Low](https://github.com/brianlow/SofleKeyboard). This layout is notable for it's semi-complex programming examples that include the use of rotary encoders.

Plenty of useful examples:
* Advanced knob programming! (Three-layer usage + clicks)
* Macros! (Fancy key combos tied to the rotary encoders)
* Tap Dance! (Double tap your '5' key for 'Enter')
* Dynamic Tapping term! (Dial in the double tap speed)

The qwerty key layout is my adaptation of the ergodox defaults. If this is your first split keyboard, you probably want a different key layout. I'm accustomed to "holding" a layer shift key. If I had to start over, I'd probably "tap" to layer shift, using raise/lower.
