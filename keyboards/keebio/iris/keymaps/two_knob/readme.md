# Two Knob Keymap for Iris Rev6a

Plenty of useful examples:
* Advanced knob programming! (Three-layer usage + clicks)
* Advanced RGB! (Per-key lighting)
* Macros! (Fancy key combos tied to the rotary encoders)
* Tap Dance! (Double tap your '5' key for 'Enter')
* Dynamic Tapping term! (Dial in the double tap speed)

The qwerty key layout is my adaptation of the ergodox defaults. If this is your first split keyboard, you probably want a different key layout. 

I stopped using the fancy RGB programming pretty quickly. It was a complex to get working initially, so I'm leaving the examples here for others. (As a touch typist - not terribly helpful, but it looks nice). YMMV.
