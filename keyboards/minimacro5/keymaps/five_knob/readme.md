# Five Knob keymap for miniMACRO5
![five_knobs](https://i.imgur.com/JqGPWCn.png)

This keymap is intended to supplement split keyboards that do not support rotary encoders. 
It is notable for it's semi-complex programming examples that include the fancy key combos tied to the 5 rotary encoders.

I use two of these knob sets, one per hand. I left the config for both hands in the keymap, and comment out one hand when compiling.
